This is the official repository for the MoBro Theme SDK. This SDK can be used for developing themes for MoBro - The
ModBros Monitoring Bro.

It is not necessary to use this repository / package inside of a theme as MoBro always serves the SDK compatible with
the version of MoBro which is installed.

If you want to develop a theme, follow the steps of our [official documentation here](https://developers.mod-bros.com/mobro-theme-sdk/).
